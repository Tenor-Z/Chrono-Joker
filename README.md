As long as Python and the necessary modules are installed on the system, Balatro can run with no issues. Simply import your save file which should be found in the %appdata% folder and modify the data directly through the 'Raw Data' tab or use the 'Edit Saved Run' option to modify various assets of the save file. Once you're finished, simply export the file back in its rightful place and run the game. The changes should
take effect almost immediately.

# Example Usage
The most effective way to use this program is to utilize it to modify the 'save.jkr' file that is created when you play through a saved run. Theoretically, you should be able to modify the 'user.jkr' file as well, though this will involve more manual editing. Open the 'save.jkr' file in the program and click on 'Edit Saved Run'. Input the values of your choice and click 'Save'. When you're all finished with modifying your save data, export the file using the 'Export' button and place it in the same directory as your previous 'save.jkr' file. Running Balatro again after accomplishing this will allow the changes to immediately take effect, giving you the perks you've always wanted!
